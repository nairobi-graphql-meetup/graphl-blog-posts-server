# graphl-blog-posts-server
This is a graphql server that stores blog posts in memory; no database hence the data in not persistent. The idea is to have a good grasp of how graphql works for it's data agnostic.

## Start server
  - navigate to the api directory doing a `cd api/`
  - spin up the server by running `npm start`
  - The server should be running on localhost port `400`
  - To run the server on `dev` and `watch` mode ensure you have installed `nodemon` by running `npm i -g nodemon` then run `npm dev`
